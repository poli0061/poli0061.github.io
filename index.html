                My name is Nika. I am 17 years old. I am from Russia and I was born in Kogalym, but now I live in Surgut. Actually, these two cities are not far away from each other just 2 hours by car. My city located in cold Siberia. I live with my parents. My mother works as a lawyer in an oil company <abbr title="Surgut Oil and Gas">SOG</abbr>. Also, I have an older sister, she was born in the 90 <sup>s</sup>.

                I can describe myself like - "hard worker", I do not like to leave things unfinished. I graduated from art school in 2020, where I studied for 6 years. Many people think that studying in art school is very easy, but it is not, you have to be a hardworking person, if you want to finish this school. When I have leisure time, I am crazy about plaing on ukulele, dancing or walking with my dog.
